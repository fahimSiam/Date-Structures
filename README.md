# Date-Structures
This is a repository for all the problems I have solved regarding data structures.(array, linkedList, stack, queue, tree) This covers all the basics in manipulating data structures.
the linear array manipulation has been done in python but all the other coding has been done in java.
this is a repository of all my assignments in CSE220(DATA STRUCTURES).
